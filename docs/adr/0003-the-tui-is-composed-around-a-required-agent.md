# The TUI is composed around a required Agent

_The Refine Interaction composition revision supersedes the TUI-owned mounting
and rejection of module constructor composition below. The required Agent and
optional Terminal are followed by independently optional Commands, Sessions and
InputHistory in both the constructor and make factory. Supplied modules are
reused; omitted defaults are created once per TUI instance. Commands owns mutable
addCommand mounting; Tui::addCommand and setStorage are removed. Commands are
configured before run, without collection freezing or live synchronization.
Branding, no automatic mounting, first-match duplicates and single-run behavior
remain unchanged._

_ADR-0005 previously superseded History and Sessions ownership. Its revision
notice now records the restored Host Application choice of initial History and
optional module composition. The historical decision text follows; apply these
scoped supersessions._

Neuron TUI follows Neuron AI's fluent construction style without copying the
Agent's subclass-based configuration model. `NeuronTui\Tui` is final, receives
a ready-to-use concrete `Agent` when it is constructed, offers `make()` as the
documented equivalent of its public constructor, and exposes only
`setTitle()`, `setSubtitle()`, `addCommand()` and `run()`. The Host Application
continues to own provider, tools, middleware, History, Sessions and the
composition of any multi-Agent system. This keeps the TUI a terminal Adapter
rather than a second owner of the Agent.

Configuration is accumulated before `run()`, and the terminal widgets and
listeners are built once inside `run()`. The instance is frozen when that
single run starts. `addCommand()` deliberately follows `Agent::addTool()`: it
accepts one command, a `CommandKitInterface`, or an array containing either, validates
each value as it is added, preserves order and does not reject duplicate names.
The first command with a repeated name is the one reached; repeated entries may
remain visible in command suggestions. This duplicate rule supersedes the
contrary rule in ADR 0002.

## Considered options

- Protected `agent()`, `title()` and `commands()` hooks were rejected. An Agent
  is specialized because its provider, instructions and tools define its
  behaviour; a TUI is composed by the Host Application.
- A constructor-only interface was rejected because every new option would
  widen the constructor and make incremental configuration less idiomatic in
  Neuron AI.
- Accepting `Workflow` or a local conversational interface was rejected for
  now. An arbitrary Workflow does not guarantee messages, streaming semantics
  or History, while Neuron AI 3.15.30's `AgentInterface` does not expose the
  History getter the TUI needs. A multi-Agent system therefore reaches the TUI
  through a coordinating concrete Agent.

## Consequences

- The public entry point is `final class NeuronTui\Tui`; the complete package
  and namespace rename is made without a compatibility layer for the former
  public entry point.
- `Tui::make($agent, $terminal)` and `new Tui($agent, $terminal)` are equivalent,
  while documentation leads with `make()`.
- No Command is mounted automatically. The Host Application adds every Command
  it wants, as established by ADR 0002.
- The Agent passed at construction is the initial Agent. A mounted command may
  still put another Agent in charge through `Controls::useAgent()`.
- Title and subtitle default to `Neuron AI` and `Agent conversation`; setters
  preserve the strings they receive without special empty-value behaviour.
- Mutating configuration after `run()` begins, or running the same instance a
  second time, is a logic error. `run()` blocks until the terminal closes and
  returns nothing; the Agent retains the History.
