/**
 * A group of Commands mounted in one line.

 * A kit carries whatever its members need to work, so a Host Application names that thing once
 * instead of once per command. What comes out is commands and nothing else: a
 * kit is unrolled when it is added, and afterwards a command that
 * arrived in a kit and one named on its own are the same thing, indexed in
 * the same list under the same rules.
 *
 * A kit can be taken with some of its members left out, or with only the
 * named ones kept, so `resume` without `clear` costs no command of one's
 * own. Both answer with a kit of their own and leave the one asked untouched,
 * so the same kit can be mounted twice, differently.
 *
 * The name avoids "toolkit", which in Neuron AI means a group of tools for
 * the model.
